# Week 1 - Introduction to Networking Devices, Cabling & Proxmox Setup

### 🗓 Duration
** September 2025 - Week 1**

---

## 🔧 Topics Covered
During the first week of my internship at **Networkers Home**, I was introduced to different **networking devices**, learned about **Ethernet cable categories**, and performed a **device audit** of our lab premises.  
I also learned about **Proxmox Virtual Environment (Proxmox VE)** and installed it on a lab server for virtualization practice.

## 🧩 Networking Devices Learned

| Device | Series / Example | Purpose |
|---------|------------------|----------|
| **Router** | Cisco 2821, 2511XM, 2611XM | Connects multiple networks and directs traffic |
| **Switch** | Cisco Catalyst 2960, 3550, 3560 | Connects devices within a LAN |
| **Firewall** | Cisco ASA 5512x, FortiGate | Provides network security and traffic filtering |
| **IPS** | Cisco IPS 4240 | Intrusion detection and prevention |
| **Server** | Dell R710, Proxmox Host | Hosts virtual machines and network services |
| **Access Point** | Cisco Aironet | Provides wireless connectivity |


## 🧵 Cable Types & Differences

| Cable Type | Max Speed | Max Distance | Shielding | Use Case |
|-------------|------------|---------------|------------|-----------|
| **Cat5** | Up to 100 Mbps | 100 m | Unshielded | Basic LAN connections |
| **Cat5e** | Up to 1 Gbps | 100 m | Improved noise reduction | Modern LANs & small offices |
| **Cat6** | Up to 10 Gbps | 55–100 m | Thicker insulation & tighter twists | Data centers & high-speed connections |

> *Cat6 cables provide better performance and less crosstalk compared to Cat5e.*

## 💻 Introduction to Proxmox VE

**Proxmox Virtual Environment (VE)** is an open-source Type-1 hypervisor used for managing virtual machines and containers.  
I learned about its architecture, features, and performed a installation on Dell server R710.

### 🧩 Steps Performed:
1. Downloaded **Proxmox VE ISO** and created a bootable USB.  
2. Installed Proxmox on a **Dell R710** server.  
3. Configured network bridge for VM connectivity.  
4. Accessed the **Proxmox Web GUI** for creating virtual machines.  
5. Created an Ubuntu Server VM for testing.  

> 🧠 Key Learning: Understood the concept of **Type 1 vs Type 2 hypervisors**, and how Proxmox allows managing multiple VMs from a centralized web interface.

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Identified and classified various Cisco devices and their functions.  
- Understood the physical layout of network racks and inventory management.  
- Learned cable standards and practical usage differences.  
- Installed and explored Proxmox VE for virtualization.

## 🧩 Reflection

This week built a solid foundation of both **hardware-level networking** and **virtualization concepts**. 
 
Performing a device audit gave me a clear idea of real-world network topologies, while working with Proxmox introduced me to enterprise-level virtual lab management.
