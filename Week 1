# Week 1 - Introduction to Networking Devices & Cabling

### 🗓 Duration
**July 2025 - Week 1**

---

## 🔧 Topics Covered
During the first week of my internship at **Networkers Home**, I learned about various **networking devices, their functions, and different types of network cables** used in real environments.

## 🧩 Networking Devices Learned

| Device | Series / Example | Purpose |
|---------|------------------|----------|
| **Router** | Cisco 2900, 3900, ISR series | Connects multiple networks and directs traffic between them |
| **Switch** | Cisco Catalyst 2960, 3750 | Connects multiple devices within a LAN |
| **Firewall** | FortiGate, Palo Alto | Protects network by controlling inbound/outbound traffic |
| **Access Point** | Cisco Aironet | Provides wireless connectivity to users |
| **Server** | Dell R710, Proxmox Host | Hosts virtual machines and network services |

## 🧵 Cable Types & Differences

| Cable Type | Max Speed | Max Distance | Shielding | Use Case |
|-------------|------------|---------------|------------|-----------|
| **Cat5** | Up to 100 Mbps | 100 meters | Unshielded | Basic LAN connections |
| **Cat5e** | Up to 1 Gbps | 100 meters | Better noise reduction | Modern networks and office use |
| **Cat6** | Up to 10 Gbps | 55–100 meters | Tighter twist & insulation | Data centers, high-speed connections |

> 🔸 *Cat 6 has thicker insulation and better resistance to crosstalk than Cat 5e.*

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Identified physical components of routers and switches (ports, console, interfaces).  
- Understood the purpose of **management ports**, **uplink ports**, and **SFP slots**.  
- Learned about **straight-through** vs **cross-over** cable usage.  
- Understood **color coding standards (T568A/B)**.  
- Observed how routers and switches are connected in lab environments.  

---

## ⚙️ Tools / Equipment Observed
- Cisco Router (ISR 2900 Series)  
- Cisco Switch (Catalyst 2960 Series)  
- LAN Tester & Crimping Tools  
- Cat5e & Cat6 Ethernet Cables

## 🧩 Reflection
This week gave me a clear understanding of **how data travels physically across a network**, how devices interconnect, and how choosing the right cable affects performance and reliability.
