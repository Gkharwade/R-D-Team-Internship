# Week 2 - Proxmox Upgrade, VPN Setup & Server Infrastructure Deployment

### 🗓 Duration
**September 2025 - Week 2**

---

## 🔧 Topics Covered
During the second week of my internship at **Networkers Home**, I performed multiple advanced setup and configuration tasks involving virtualization, VPN deployment, and physical server management.  
The key focus was on **Proxmox upgrade**, **OpenVPN and pfSense installation**, **bare-metal Linux server setup**, and **building a server pod** integrated with firewalls, switches, and servers.

## 💻 Proxmox Installation & Upgrade

**Proxmox VE (Virtual Environment)** is a Debian-based open-source hypervisor for managing virtual machines and containers.  
After learning basic installation in Week 1, I upgraded our existing Proxmox infrastructure from **version 7.4 to 9.0 (latest)**.

### 🧩 Steps Performed:
1. Verified current version and performed a full backup of existing VMs.  
2. Updated repositories and performed the version upgrade via CLI.  
3. Reconfigured network bridges and storage pools post-upgrade.  
4. Verified node health and cluster synchronization.  
5. Installed **PnetLab** inside Proxmox for network simulation and device emulation.  

> 🧠 *Key Learning:* Understood the Proxmox upgrade process, repository management, and how to handle version compatibility between host and guest systems.

## 🌐 Introduction to VPN & pfSense / OPNsense

This week introduced me to the concepts of **Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)** and how they are implemented using **pfSense** and **OPNsense**.

### 🧩 Tasks Completed:
- Installed **pfSense** and **OPNsense** inside Proxmox as virtual appliances.  
- Configured WAN and LAN interfaces with proper IP addressing.  
- Learned about **OpenVPN server-client configuration** and **SSL/TLS authentication**.  
- Set up firewall rules for VPN access and tested remote connectivity.  

> 🔒 *Key Learning:* Understood the purpose of VPNs in securing remote access and how firewall appliances manage encrypted communication channels.

## 🖥️ Linux (Ubuntu) Server Installation

I installed a **bare-metal Ubuntu Server** on physical hardware for hosting various network services.

### 🧩 Steps:
1. Installed **Ubuntu Server LTS** on a Dell PowerEdge R710.  
2. Configured network interfaces and SSH remote access.  
3. Installed packages for virtualization tools and network monitoring.  
4. Linked it to Proxmox for testing VM migration and file sharing.

> 🧠 *Key Learning:* Learned to handle OS installation directly on server hardware (bare-metal) and manage it as part of a virtualized environment.

## 🧱 Server Pod Setup

We built a **server pod** combining multiple enterprise devices, including:

| Device | Brand / Model | Purpose |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| **Firewall** | Checkpoint, Palo Alto | Network perimeter security and policy management |
| **Switches** | Cisco Catalyst 3560, 2960 | Internal LAN connectivity and VLAN segmentation |
| **Servers** | Dell PowerEdge R710 / UCS B200 | Hosting Proxmox, pfSense, and Ubuntu instances |

> 🧠 *Key Learning:* Understood how a complete enterprise pod integrates firewalls, switches, and servers to form a lab ecosystem for testing and training.

## 🧩 Installed PnetLab Inside Proxmox

**PnetLab** was installed within the Proxmox server to simulate advanced Cisco and firewall labs.

### 🧩 Key Steps:
- Imported the **PnetLab ISO** into Proxmox as a virtual machine.  
- Configured networking (bridge mode) to allow external access.  
- Integrated Cisco images (IOSv, IOL, ASA, FortiGate) for topology creation.  
- Tested router-to-firewall and LAN-WAN scenarios.

> 🧠 *Key Learning:* Understood how virtualization enables multi-device lab creation, saving hardware resources while providing real-world configuration practice.

## 🧠 Summary
This week strengthened my understanding of **enterprise virtualization and security solutions**.  
Upgrading Proxmox taught me version management and system maintenance, while working with **pfSense/OPNsense** gave me practical exposure to VPN concepts and firewall configurations.  
Building the server pod and deploying **PnetLab** tied everything together, allowing me to simulate complex network setups on a virtualized platform.

## 🧾 Reflection
Week 2 provided hands-on experience in **integrating physical and virtual network environments**.  
It helped me understand how enterprise systems evolve — from hardware installation to virtualized environments and secure remote access.  
By combining **Proxmox, pfSense, and PnetLab**, I now have a clear vision of how large-scale labs and corporate networks are designed, managed, and secured.
